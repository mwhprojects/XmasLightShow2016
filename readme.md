# About XmasLightShow2016
These are all of the files from my Arduino Christmas Light Show 2016.

Watch the show on YouTube: https://youtu.be/lBe9xZuFu9k

Admittedly, the files are in a poor state -- Not much documentation and unfinished features. I decided to put them out anyway since people ask for code whenever I post one of my Arduino Light Shows.

# Files
Visual Basic: All of the files in this folder are to open the project in Visual Studio.

Arduino: The show was built off one of the FastLED library examples. The two songs in the show are split up on two sketches since the sketch is too big with both shows on one.
